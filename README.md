# Historical-pricing-analysis

Creating a master file of all the historical pricing starting 2018 - present of teh PCBA components. 
Pre-processing the data: 
  1.  Loading that dataset into python and then removing the outliers and normalising the data to fit into the model.
  2.  Fiting a Multiple Linear Regression Model and General Linear Model to determine the Target Price of the components based on historical pricing and its major cost-drivers.
  
  This helped the Purchasing team at Tesla identify future cost saving opportunities, identify the best vendors and gain insights into the historical buying trends.
